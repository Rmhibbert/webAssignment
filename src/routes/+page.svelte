  <p>Founded in the summer of 2018, SunSplash Beverages emerged from the dream of two beach-loving friends, Alex and Maya.</p>
  <p>Their shared passion for tropical getaways, sandy shores, and refreshing drinks inspired them to create a brand that would capture the essence of summer in every sip.</p>
  <p>With a mission to bring the taste of sunshine to people's lives, they embarked on a journey to craft the most delightful and rejuvenating summer drinks.</p>
