This repo has been created to hold the web project for the bussiness sunsplash beverages who sell summer inspired drinks.
I have coded this website using html,css and java script, it also incluses an api
The project is created and run in svelte kit. 
My website includes a homepage which has a description of the drinks avalible and a image scrolling effect.
My page can be navigated using the nav bar or footer links.
I have a drinks page which has each drinks ingredents displayed along with a pralax image of the drink
The gallery page features an api and is dispalyed in a 2x3 format with rounded corners and a bulging hover effect
All my pages are fully scaleble down to 320px, i have included an mobile nav bar using a hamburger menu and a page overlay
On mulitple ocations i have used the flex dispaly to change the dircetion of my divs to dispaly my infomation acording to my page width
